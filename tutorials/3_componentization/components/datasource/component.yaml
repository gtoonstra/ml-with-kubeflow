# This part is the component description, describing the interface
# for the application.
name: datasource
description: Generates some data for us to work with.
inputs:
    # There are no inputs for this application
outputs:
  - name: Output Path   # This is the name of the output
    type: OutputPath    # The type determines how it is applied in kubeflow.
                        # Simple types are simply passed, InputPath and OutputPath are more managed.
implementation:
  # The implementation part describes how the inputs/outputs described above are
  # applied to the "implementation". So you'll see the names repeated, but that makes sense.
  # It decouples the "component interface" part from the "how to run with those parameters" part.
