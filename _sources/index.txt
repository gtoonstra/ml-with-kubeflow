ETL best practices with Airflow documentation site
==================================================

.. important::

    **Disclaimer**: This is not the official documentation site for
    Apache airflow. This site is not affiliated, monitored or controlled by
    the official Apache Airflow development effort. If you are looking for
    the official documentation site, please follow this link:

    `Official Airflow documentation <https://airflow.incubator.apache.org/>`_

    What you will find here are interesting examples, usage patterns and
    ETL principles that I thought are going to help people use airflow to
    much better effect.
