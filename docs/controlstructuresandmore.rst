Control structures and more
===========================

This tutorial shows the usage of control structures that skip parts of the pipeline.
It's also a great tutorial demonstrating how kubeflow figures out the order in which to
execute the tasks.

You can run the code on your cluster, or inspect the notebook from the tutorials directory
on github:
