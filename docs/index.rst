ML with Kubeflow documentation site
===================================

.. important::

    **Disclaimer**: This is not the official documentation site for
    Kubeflow. This site is not affiliated, monitored or controlled by
    the official Kubeflow development effort. If you are looking for
    the official documentation site, please follow this link:

    `Official Kubeflow documentation <https://www.kubeflow.org//>`_

    What you will find here is a step-by-step tutorial, incrementally increasing
    the complexity and adding more capabilities from Kubeflow.

    Why?  As I started learning about Kubeflow, I found it confusing:
    - There have been some versions already and some examples only apply to the older versions
    - The examples are in different repositories, only online or are difficult to execute on your
      deployment of Kubeflow
    - The concepts are sometimes described, but not exemplified, and you need to look for a working
      example to understand how it works in practice.
