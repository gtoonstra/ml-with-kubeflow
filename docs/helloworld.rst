Hello world
===========

The first venture into kubeflow can be accessed from the local repository. If you're on the cloud,
you have to upload that first (or sync the repository remotely on the VM that you created using the
github link). Otherwise, you can start jupyter lab from the "tutorials" directory. When the UI spins up,
you can then access each notebook by browsing the directories on the left.

Further instructions and explanations are in each notebook. These notebooks are rendered and also
accessible on github:

`Notebooks directory <https://github.com/gtoonstra/ml-with-kubeflow/tree/master/tutorials>`_
